# Welcome to my place!

### Who am I?
I am Antoine.c, a 16 years old french student and aspiring (game) developer.

### What are my projects?
For now, I'm just experimenting things with *Python*. I also plan to make apps with *JS*, but for now Python takes all my time (I don't have that mcuh time)
My current projects:
* Text-based RPG game in Python (my first project!)
* A little platformer with [Godot engine](http://godotengine.org)
* Some other little projects (I may upload them in a repo for these types of projects one day)
* More "serious stuff" with Python: Homework and computer/programming classes (4h/week, and then 6h/week the next year)

### What are my other hobbies?
I like programming **a lot**, but I also like:
* Reading
* Playing video games (League of Legends w/ friends, Albion Online, Minecraft and some other casual games)
* Writing things
* Making tabletop RPGs and small boardgames!
* Discovering new ways of creating things (like PuzzleScript, Bitsy... These are all original and fun ways to create things!)

Alright that's all for now, I may add other questions later, cya :smile:
